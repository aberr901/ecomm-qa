# QA Bug Report


## Bug 1: Not Mobile Friendly

- **Impact:**
  - Many relevant users will frequently access the application from mobile devices or tablets. This makes mobile usability critical for daily operations and productivity.

- **Description:**
  - The application UI does not fully adapt to mobile screens. Several elements and spaces fail to resize dynamically, resulting in horizontal scrolling, overlapping text, and fixed-width components that do not fit smaller screens.

- **Steps to Reproduce:**
  1. Open the application (ecomcentral.app) on a mobile device or tablet (see screenshots below).
  2. Navigate through the main dashboard, logistics, and payments sections.
  3. Observe layout issues, such as:
     - Side navigation and content areas not resizing
     - Table columns overflowing or text being cut off
     - Action buttons and filters not adapting to screen width

- **Expected Result:**
  - All UI elements and spaces should resize and adapt dynamically for mobile screens, with no horizontal scrolling or overlapping content.

- **Actual Result:**
  - Some elements remain fixed-width or overflow, causing:
    - Horizontal scrolling
    - Overlapping or truncated text in tables
    - Action buttons and filters not fully visible
